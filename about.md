## What is CSOPL? ##
The Colorado Springs One Pocket League is a ranked, weighted, weekly one-pocket league. Face opponents every week in a fairly weighted match and compete with others to be at the top of your division to get an invite into a session's end tournament with thousands of dollars in the prize pool.

### How to Play ###
Play a different opponent from your division every week in a race to three games. Check out [the official BCA one-pocket rules](https://www.billiards.com/blogs/articles/official-bca-one-pocket-rules) for more information on how to play.

### OPL Rating ###
CSOPL has an elo style rating system to enable fair matches regardless of skill level. New players start with a rating of 600, and ratings go up or down with every reported game. Match weights are determined by the difference in rating between the two players:
|Rating Difference|Match Weight|
|---|---|
| 0-50 | 8-8 |
| 51-100 | 8-7 |
| 101-150 | 9-7 |
| 151-200 | 9-6 |
| 201-250 | 10-6 |
| 251-300 | 10-5 |
| 301-350 | 11-5 |
| 351-400 | 11-4 |
| 401-450 | 12-4 |

### OPL Division ###
Players are placed into divisions with up to 7 other players. Each division meets on the same day each week to play their match at the same time each week. Match schedules can be viewed in the app.

### OPL Session ###
Each session consists of a double round robin, where each player is matched against every other player twice. Each match is a race to three games, and players can earn up to three points:
|Score|Winner|Loser|
|-|-|-|
|3-0|3 points|0 points|
|3-1|2 points|0 points|
|3-2|2 points|1 point|

To report the match results and receive points, both players submit a signed score sheet along with $10 for league dues. Any match that does not have a score sheet or league dues is not scored.

### End of Session Tournament ###
All league dues are collected in a pot to be used as the prize pool for a double elimination tournament at the end of the session. The top four players from each division are invited to play for a piece of the prize pool.
